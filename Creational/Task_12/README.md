# Task 12

Implement a Prototype pattern for a clothing store system: The Clothing interface should have methods for displaying the clothing details and a clone method.
Concrete classes should implement this interface for different types of clothing (e.g. T-Shirt, Dress, Pants).
The prototype method should take in the type of the clothing and return the appropriate clothing object.

## Steps

1- Define the Clothing interface with methods for displaying the clothing details and a clone method.

2- Create concrete classes that implement this interface for different types of clothing (e.g. T-Shirt, Dress, Pants).

3- Implement the prototype method that takes in the type of the clothing and returns the appropriate clothing object.

4- Use the prototype method to create the appropriate clothing object for the given clothing type.

5- Call the methods of the clothing object to display its details.
