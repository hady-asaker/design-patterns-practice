# Task 07

Implement a factory method pattern for a pizza restaurant: Define an interface for the pizza object and create concrete classes that implement it for different types of pizzas (e.g. Margherita, Pepperoni, Hawaiian). The factory method should take in the type of the pizza and return the appropriate pizza object.

## Steps

1- Define the pizza interface with methods for preparing, baking, and serving the pizza.

2- Create concrete classes that implement this interface for each type of pizza (e.g.      Margherita pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Hawaiian pizza).

3- Implement the factory method that takes in the type of the pizza and returns the appropriate pizza object.

4- Use the factory method to create the appropriate pizza object for the given pizza type.

5- Call the methods of the pizza object to prepare, bake, and serve the pizza.

6- Handle any errors that may occur during the pizza-making process.
