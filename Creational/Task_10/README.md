# Task 10

Create a prototype object for a vehicle with some properties and methods, such as make, model, and year, and a method called drive(). Then, create a clone of the vehicle object with two additional methods called startEngine() and stopEngine(), and a new property called fuelLevel.

## Steps

1- Define the prototype object for a vehicle with some properties and methods, such as make, model, and year, and a method called drive().

2- Add a new method to the vehicle prototype object called startEngine() that outputs "The engine is started."

3- Add another new method to the vehicle prototype object called stopEngine() that outputs "The engine is stopped."

4- Clone the vehicle prototype object using the clone keyword to create a new object.

5- Add a new property to the cloned object called fuelLevel, with an initial value of 100.

6- Add a new method called startEngine() to the new cloned object that outputs "The engine is started."

7- Add a new method called stopEngine() to the new cloned object that outputs "The engine is stopped."

8- Access the drive(), startEngine(), stopEngine(), and fuelLevel methods and properties of the new object to verify that it was cloned successfully with the new features added.
