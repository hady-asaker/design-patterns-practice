# Task 05

Implement a builder pattern for a house builder: You can create a builder class that takes in the house type (e.g. ranch, colonial, Victorian), the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the style of the kitchen and living room, and any additional features, and returns a house object with the specified attributes.

## Steps

1- Define the house class with the necessary attributes such as type, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

2- Define the builder class with methods to set the attributes of the house object.

3- Define a director class (optional) that uses the builder to construct the house object and returns it to the client.

4- Implement the client code to use the builder to construct the house object with the desired attributes.

5- Add a method to the builder class to calculate the cost of building the house based on its attributes.

6- Implement error handling in the builder class to handle any errors related to the cost calculation.
