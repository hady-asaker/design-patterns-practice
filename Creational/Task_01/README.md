# Task 01

Creating a Button Factory: In this task, you can create an abstract factory that creates different types of buttons such as a text button, image button, or icon button. The concrete factory can create buttons with different styles or sizes.

## Steps

1- Define an abstract button factory interface that declares a method for creating a button.

2- Create concrete button factories that implement the button factory interface and create specific types of buttons such as text buttons, image buttons, or icon buttons.

3- Define an abstract button class or interface that specifies the methods and properties that all buttons must implement.

4- Create concrete button classes that implement the abstract button class or interface and provide the specific functionality for each type of button.

5- In your client code, create an instance of the concrete button factory that you want to use, and call its createButton() method to create a button object.
