# Task 02

Developing a Shape Factory: You can create a shape factory that can create different types of shapes such as circles, rectangles, or triangles. The concrete factory can create shapes with different colors or border thicknesses.

## Steps

1- Define an abstract shape factory interface that declares a method for creating a shape.

2- Create concrete shape factories that implement the shape factory interface and create specific types of shapes such as circles, rectangles, or triangles.

3- Define an abstract shape class or interface that specifies the methods and properties that all shapes must implement.

4- Create concrete shape classes that implement the abstract shape class or interface and provide the specific functionality for each type of shape.

5- In your client code, create an instance of the concrete shape factory that you want to use, and call its createShape() method to create a shape object.
