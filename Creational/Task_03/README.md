# Task 03

Building a Font Factory: With the Abstract Factory Pattern, you can create a font factory that can create different types of fonts such as serif, sans-serif, or monospace. The concrete factory can create fonts with different sizes or weights.

## Steps

1- Define an abstract font factory interface that declares a method for creating a font.

2- Create concrete font factories that implement the font factory interface and create specific types of fonts such as serif, sans-serif, or monospace.

3- Define an abstract font class or interface that specifies the methods and properties that all fonts must implement.

4- Create concrete font classes that implement the abstract font class or interface and provide the specific functionality for each type of font.

5- n your client code, create an instance of the concrete font factory that you want to use, and call its createFont() method to create a font object.
