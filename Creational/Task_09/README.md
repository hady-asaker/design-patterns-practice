# Task 09

Implement a factory method pattern for a coffee shop: The coffee interface should have methods for brewing, adding milk/sugar, and serving the coffee.
Concrete classes should implement this interface for different types of coffee (e.g. Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).
The factory method should take in the type of the coffee and return the appropriate coffee object.

## Steps

1- Define the coffee interface with methods for brewing, adding milk/sugar, and serving the coffee.

2- Create concrete classes that implement this interface for different types of coffee (e.g. Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).

3- Implement the factory method that takes in the type of the coffee and returns the appropriate coffee object.

4- Use the factory method to create the appropriate coffee object for the given coffee type.

5- Call the methods of the coffee object to brew, add milk/sugar, and serve the coffee.

6- Handle any errors that may occur during the coffee-making process.
