# Task 08

Implement a factory method pattern for a car dealership: Define an interface for the car object and create concrete classes that implement it for different types of cars (e.g. SUV, Sedan, Truck). The factory method should take in the type of the car and return the appropriate car object.

## Steps

1- Define the car interface with methods for assembling, testing, and delivering the car.

2- Create concrete classes that implement this interface for each type of car (e.g. SUV, Sedan, Truck).

3- Implement the factory method that takes in the type of the car and returns the appropriate car object.

4- Use the factory method to create the appropriate car object for the given car type.

5- Call the methods of the car object to assemble, test, and deliver the car.

6- Handle any errors that may occur during the car-making process.
