# Task 06

Implement a builder pattern for a workout builder: You can create a builder class that takes in the workout type (e.g. strength training, cardio, yoga), the number of sets and reps, the equipment needed, and any additional requests, and returns a workout object with the specified attributes.

## Steps

1- Define the clothing item class with the necessary attributes such as type, size, color, etc.

2- Define the builder class with methods to set the attributes of the clothing item object.

3- Define a director class (optional) that uses the builder to construct the clothing item object and returns it to the client.

4- Implement the client code to use the builder to construct the clothing item object with the desired attributes.

5- Add a method to the builder class to calculate the price of the clothing item based on its attributes.

6-  Implement error handling in the builder class to handle any errors related to the price calculation.
