# Task 04

Implement a builder pattern for a pizza ordering system: You can create a builder class that takes in the pizza size, toppings, crust type, and any special requests, and returns a pizza object with the specified attributes.

## Steps

1- Define the pizza class with the necessary attributes such as size, toppings, crust type, etc.

2- Define the builder class with methods to set the attributes of the pizza object.

3- Define a director class (optional) that uses the builder to construct the pizza object and returns it to the client.

4- Implement the client code to use the builder to construct the pizza object with the desired attributes.

5- Use the built-in validation methods of the builder class to ensure the attributes of the pizza object are valid.
