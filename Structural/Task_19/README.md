# Task 19

Implement a virtual proxy for large images

In this task, you will implement a virtual proxy for large images. When an image is too large to be loaded into memory, a virtual proxy can be used to load only a portion of the image that is currently visible on the screen. As the user scrolls or zooms in/out, the proxy can load additional portions of the image as needed.


## Steps

1- Define the Image interface: 

* The first step is to define the interface that declares the methods for loading and displaying the image. 
* This interface should include methods for loading the image data and displaying the image on the screen.

2- Implement a concrete Image class: 

* That loads and displays the entire image. This class should implement the methods declared in the Image interface, loading the entire image into memory when the loadImage() method is called.

3- Implement a virtual proxy class: 

* That also implements the Image interface. This proxy class should hold a reference to the concrete Image class, but only load a portion of the image when the loadImage() method is called. 
* This partial loading should be achieved using methods such as cropImage() or resizeImage() to only load the portion of the image that is currently visible on the screen.

4- Load additional portions of the image: 

* When the user scrolls or zooms in/out, update the virtual proxy to load additional portions of the image as needed. 
* This can be done by dynamically adjusting the crop or resize parameters based on the user's interaction with the image. 
* This functionality can be implemented using methods such as zoomIn(), zoomOut(), scrollUp(), scrollDown(), scrollLeft(), and scrollRight(). 
* These methods can be called on the virtual proxy class, which will adjust the portion of the image displayed accordingly.
