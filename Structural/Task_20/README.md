# Task 20

Build a Remote Proxy for Network Communication

In this task, you will build a remote proxy that provides a local representation of a remote object, allowing clients to access and manipulate the remote object as if it were a local object. This can be useful for network communication scenarios where the remote object is located on a different machine or in a different process.


## Steps

1- Define the interface for the remote object: 

* The first step is to define the interface that the remote object implements, which specifies the methods that can be called remotely. 
For example: get_data(), set_data(value), perform_action(param1, param2).


2- Implement a remote object: 

* Next, implement the remote object that implements the interface and provides the actual implementation of the methods.
* if the interface has a method get_data(), the remote object would provide the implementation of that method to return the data from a remote source.

3- Implement a remote proxy: 

* Implement a proxy class that implements the same interface as the remote object. 
* The remote proxy should act as a local representation of the remote object, handling all communication between the client and the remote object.
* the proxy could have a method get_data() that sends a request to the remote object to retrieve the data.

4- Implement remote method invocation: 

* The remote proxy should use a network protocol, such as TCP/IP or HTTP, to communicate with the remote object and invoke its methods remotely.
* when the get_data() method is called on the proxy, it should send a network request to the remote object to retrieve the data and return it to the client.

5- Handle communication errors: 

* Handle any communication errors that may occur during remote method invocation, such as network errors or remote object failures. 
* The remote proxy should provide appropriate error messages to the client in case of failures.
* if the remote object is unavailable, the proxy could return an error message indicating that the remote object is not responding.
